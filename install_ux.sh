__________________________The_bB_Unix_Installer_v1__________________________

This script will update your $PROFILE file to 
set the following variables each time you open a terminal window.

  export bB="$bB"
  export PATH=\$PATH:\$bB

You may run this script as many times as you like, and should do so if you're
installing a new version of bB, or if you relocate this bB directory.

Hit [ENTER] to begin, or type Q and [ENTER] to quit.

$PROFILE has been updated successfully.

To test the new setup...

  1. open another terminal window. 
     (the bB and PATH variables will now be active in any new terminal window)
  2. type:  cd "\$bB/samples"
  3. type:  2600basic.sh zombie_chase.bas

This should create a zombie_chase.bas.bin binary file in the samples directory 
that will work on real hardware, in stella, or any other emulator.
