  There are some niggling issues and/or unexpected behaviors that users
  may run across. This file explains those issues, and any known
  work-arouds.

_Known_Issues_

  overview:   A wide score font causes glitching on the right-most digit.
  details:    There isn't sufficient kernel time for the update of all 6
              score digits *and* the PF bars, so the standard score font
              doesn't display the left-most digit.
  workaround: avoid defining graphics in the left-most pixel column of the
              score font.

  overview:   Some kernels have a score that is off-center.
  details:    There isn't sufficient kernel time for the update of all 6
              score digits *and* the PF bars, so the standard score is
              positioned to minimize the resulting glitch resulting from
              this.
  workaround: use the DPC+ kernel, or ignore it.

  overview:   DPC+ vsprite vertical stack glitch.
  details:    If the virtual sprites are stacked with very little
              spacing, cumulative round-off can occur, and eventually coarse
              positioning will happen during a virtual sprite display,
              resulting in a visual glitch.
  workaround: avoid stacking vsprites vertically without much
              spacing. Or put them all on even or all odd rows, depending
              if the height of the vsprites are even or odd.

  overview:   PAL pfres linecount bug.
  details:    Using "set tv pal" with standard kernel and pfres
              causes incorrect scanline counts for certian pfres values.
              workaround: use a value that provides a correct linecount, or
              use pal60 instead.

  overview:   DPC+ double-line bug
  details:    In higher resolutions in the DPC+ kernel, the top PF line is
              duplicated.
  workaround: None
